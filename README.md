# EsportSource
A basic Django project to allow for user generated articles and discussion about esports

Allows people to create, and vote on esports articles on various competitive online games.
The articles created are displayed using a template, and Disqus is added to the footer of each
article for commenting purposes.

Still a work in progress.
